# Country Addict

Country Addict is a web application that lets you explore countries and information about countries from around the world. You can filter countries by population, name, and region (continent), as well as search for a specific country by name. Additionally, you can click on a country to view detailed information, including currency, native name, and bordering countries. If you click on a bordering country, it will take you to that country's page.
